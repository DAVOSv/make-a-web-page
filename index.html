<h2>Lesson 1: In the beginning...</h2>
  <div class="How the internet works">
  <b> How the internet works</b>
    <p>The internet is a group of computers that work with each other 
 to transfer information. The world wide web uses HTML to transfer information back and forth. 
 First a computer will link to a web page, that sends an http request to a server ( a computer 
 that hosts the requested information.)
 The server sends the information back to the computer. The information is interpreted through 
 a web browser and displays the information in a visual format.

  <div class="html notes">
 <b>HTML</b>
  <p>Text content - What you see </p>

  <div class="html markup notes">
  <b> HTML Markup</b>
  <p>A tag is a reference to a purpose made in an html document that tells the website what to do
  with the following information.  </p>
  <p>An element is a line of code with both an opening and closing tag and some content for the tags to act on.</p>

  <div class="dumb robot notes">
  <b>Specificity</b>
  <p>Computers need exact instructions to operate as intended. This applies to the internet as well.
    One wrong direction or typo can have major unintended consequences.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="html attributes notes">
  <b>HTML Attributes</b>
  <p>Each HTML element is either inline or block. Inline is just for text. Block creatles a box around the element and 
  can work with both text and other kinds of content</p>

  <div class="everything is boxinated notes">
  <b>BOXES</b>
    <p>Everything visual on the internet works on a grid system creating sections of boxes for the different content.
    </p>
    <p>When visually analyzing a pages structure one should go from larger to small boxes as to break the page down properly to its smaller more specific finer details.
